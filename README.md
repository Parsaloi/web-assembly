# web-assembly
A mini-project series to learn how to compile code that targets web-assembly deployments

## This is purely experimental

To experiment with web-assembly writing C/C++ that will compile to JS code for the web:  
- First download and install the `emcc` or `em++` compiler from the official source
- Write some C/C++ code
- Compile it to JS code by running:  

```bash
emcc test_code.c
```

> Webassembly is pretty cool...currently testing this technology
